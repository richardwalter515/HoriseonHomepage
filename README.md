## HoriseonHomepage

Horiseon's Homepage has been refactored to meet accessibility standards.  This includes adding "alt" tags to images, naming containers with appropriate semantic labels (instead of general "div"), ensuring all links are working, and updating the title in the head portion to a descriptive name.  This also helps with Search Engine Optimization. 

Additionally, the CSS has been consolidated where possible to make the code more easily understood and sustainable for future use.
